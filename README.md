I'm a fullstack developer focused on building web apps that are easy to use and reliable. I care about clean interfaces and solid backend systems. No unnecessary complexity, just software that does its job.

At SAP, I led the rewrite of a virtual events broadcasting platform, optimizing video experience and accessibility for audiences up to 50,000. I architected a real-time subtitling system using machine learning, and implemented a P2P video distribution system for scalability.

At 9thCO, I build accessible, high-performance websites and custom plugins for Storyblok and Strapi, including DeepL-powered translation and SendGrid newsletter automation.

If I'm not coding, you'll probably find me building mechanical keyboards, snowboarding, or catching up on sci-fi and fantasy. Yes, I've seen Lord of the Rings more times than I can count. I also like to reset with a good book, a run, or just some quality time with my wife.
